# MotoApp
Hello, everybody!
I'm in love with bikes and it's my pet project for anyone, who want to enjot bikes more! :)

I'm creating an app for motorcycle riders and looking for any wishes or needs, which can be covered by this MotoApp.
So, feel free to advise an idea!:)

**For now:**
*Screen2: There is the catalog, where you can find any motorcycle by brand or by type.*

**To be developed:**

**Screen 1**: *Profile of the Garage with your motorcycles.*

In Garage screen you will see:
*Top bar*:
Your username + some buttons.
*MainScreenContent* (from top bar to bottomr bar):
Your motorcycles in list (ViewPager). You can see image of your bike, which you added to your Garage, some buttons for info and tech repair info.
Can be added Avatar (biker which you can edit clothes and helmet and etc) to MainScreenContent.

From Garage you can update hours in *HourMeter*.
Button *Check For Planned Maintenance* and see info when you need to change oil or piston, top-end rebuild, bottom rebuild.

**Screen 3**: *Drive&Fun*
Smoking and flying, no drinking and driving. :D

Here you will see information  
List of your friends in this app.
You can add to friends. See their bikes, invite for a ride your friend and setup some location or choose from your Saved locations.

Enduro screen of rides will be from Button on this screen.
You can start enduro trip ride and your phone will track your ride, so you can see where you've been, where is your friend now and how to meet again in this wild deep forest :)

**Screen 4**: *Your profile of user.*

In User Profile screen you will see:
Your name or gang-name.
Some buttons to edit User Profile.
Information about your Garage and bikes in it.
Options to add/remove bike to/from Garage from Moto-Catalog.
Other info about your User Profile.
